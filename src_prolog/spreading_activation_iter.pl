%
% This procedure performs the spreading activation algorithm on the graph defined from the original instances of Graph Brain (restructured in the
% list-based formalism) to identify which are its most important nodes starting from a list of 'start nodes'.
% In this 'eps' formulation, the spreading activation algorithm will stop if the L1 norm between the activation values of nodes at the beginning of 
% the iteration compared to the values at the end of it is less than the specified Epsilon.
%
% Note that, in this formulation:
%   - nodes that have been previously fired may fire again;
%   - the geometric decay rate is used rather than the linear one, as in the basic formulation.
%
% The procedure loads automatically the list-based graph from 'outputs' directory. If more than one eligible list-based graph is available,
% the user is prompted to choose the appropriate one.
%
% The algorithm results can be checked by invoking the 'activation' procedure:
%   - e.g. activation(0, X) X is the activation value for node with id 0
%
% Arguments:
%   StartNodes: List of node identifiers to use as 'start nodes' (their activation value will be set to 1);
%   FiringThreshold: The minimum activation value necessary for a node to keep spreading over to its neighbors;
%   DecayRate: The activation value decay when it is spread to neighboring nodes.
%   GeometricDecayFactor: Factor by which the DecayRate will be reduced at the end of the iteration;
%   Epsilon: Threshold value, the algorithm will stop once StopCrit is lower than this value;ù
%   NMaxIter: Maximum number of iterations after which the algorithm will stop regardless of convergence

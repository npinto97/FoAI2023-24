## Abstract
This project presents the development of a decision support system tailored for software management within a software house. The system leverages ontologies to structure and represent knowledge, utilizing GraphBRAIN for ontology translation and Neo4j for data storage. A custom software ontology was created, integrating with existing ontologies and populated using data extracted from Wikidata via SPARQL queries. The knowledge base was further translated into Prolog, enabling the creation of rules to facilitate decision-making. This documentation outlines the methodology, tools, and processes used, and highlights the system's potential applications in real-world software management scenarios.
